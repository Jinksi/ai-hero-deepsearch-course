      You are comparing a submitted answer to an expert answer on a given question. Here is the data:

      Compare the factual content of the submitted answer with the expert answer. Ignore any differences in style, grammar, or punctuation.
      The submitted answer may either be a subset or superset of the expert answer, or it may conflict with it. Determine which case applies. Answer the question by selecting one of the following options:
      (A) The submitted answer is a subset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.
      (B) The submitted answer is a superset of the expert answer and is fully consistent with it.
      (C) The submitted answer contains all the same details as the expert answer.
      (D) There is a disagreement between the submitted answer and the expert answer.
      (E) The answers differ, but these differences don't matter from the perspective of factuality.
